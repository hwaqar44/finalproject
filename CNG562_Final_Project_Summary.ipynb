Quora values canonical questions because they provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term.\n",

Doing so will make it easier to find high quality answers to questions resulting in an improved experience for Quora writers, seekers, and readers."

        "The goal of this competition is to predict which of the provided pairs of questions contain two questions with the same meaning. The ground truth is the set of labels that have been supplied by human experts. The ground truth labels are inherently subjective, as the true meaning of sentences can never be known with certainty. Human labeling is also a 'noisy' process, and reasonable people will disagree. As a result, the ground truth labels on this dataset should be taken to be 'informed' but not 100% accurate, and may include incorrect labeling. We believe the labels, on the whole, to represent a reasonable consensus, but this may often not be true on a case by case basis for individual items in the dataset.\n",

The model is first trained with Google news data , that about 700 mbs of Google data related to news, than we check the similarty between each question and the new feature named 'wmd' is saved all the WMD distances between questions. The questions themselves are first seperated in to 2. the one with the root words only, and others with no common words. \n",
        "Next we create feature using Spacy Model. Spacy check each word and check the similar words ratio and between each sentances. So we create new feature name 'spacy_similarity' and 'spacy_sameqs_similarity' for both types of quesitons. \n",
        "Fuzz ration is another library that check the sentance similarity, i have also used that. More than 30 new features have been created from the 2 questions, using different librareis and models.\n",
        "Than we check all the features by splitting the data in to training and test sets.\n",
